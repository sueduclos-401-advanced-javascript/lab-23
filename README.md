# LAB 23 - Class 23
Code 401 Class 23 Props and State

## Project Name - RESTy app

build out the RESTy app, which is a simple clone of Postman. This application should have a few areas of user input, which is then used to make an HTTP request using fetch().

Users should have the following interactable components:

A text input field to enter an API URL
A collection of buttons / A select dropdown to choose which REST method to use (GET, POST, PUT or DELETE)
A submit button that sends the request via HTTP
In this lab, you do not need to provide input fields for users to set their request headers or request body. We will be building upon this application in later labs.

Once the user submits their chosen request, your application should carry out the request and then visually display the response headers and response body to the user. For this lab, you only have to code for APIs that return JSON data in the response body. The response JSON content should be “pretty printed”, or properly tabbed / spaced.
